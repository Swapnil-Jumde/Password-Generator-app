# Password-Generator-app
The password generator app developed using Python language and modules such as Random and Tkinter provides a simple and effective way to create secure and strong passwords. The app takes an input from the user for the length of alphabets, symbols, and numbers, allowing them to define the length of each character type.

The app provides two options for generating passwords: user and auto. In the user mode, the user can define the length of each character type, providing a more personalized and customizable approach to password creation. In the auto mode, the app automatically generates a password based on a set algorithm, providing a quick and easy way to generate a secure password.

The app includes a copy button, allowing the user to easily copy the generated password to their clipboard and use it for their accounts. The use of the Random module ensures that the generated password is completely random and not predictable, increasing its security and making it harder for anyone to guess or crack.

Overall, the password generator app is a simple yet effective tool that provides a convenient way to generate secure passwords. With its user-friendly interface and customizable options, the app ensures that users can create strong and unique passwords with ease, ensuring the safety and security of their accounts.
